# DEPRECATED

> These packages are deprecated and are loosely maintained. We suggest using the following tools
> instead: [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) (replaces ESLint + Prettier), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
> (replaces Jest), and [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) (replaces Babel).

# moon development

This repository is a collection of moon owned and maintained developer tools and shared
configurations/presets for common JavaScript tooling -- primarily tools used by moonrepo and its
authors.

## Editor extensions

This repo houses the official moon VS Code extension,
[moonrepo.moon-console](./packages/vscode-extension)! It is currently under heavy development, but
is in a usable condition.

## Shared configurations

The following packages are not tied to [moon](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon) directly, and can be
used stand-alone within their respective JavaScript tools.

They aim to provide a strict, modern, developer accessible, convention over configuration approach
to JavaScript, TypeScript (first), and React/Solid projects! All of these configs have been designed
for local and developer tooling based development!

- [babel-preset-moon](./packages/babel-preset) - Babel preset that utilizes `env`, `typescript`, and
  `react` presets.
- [eslint-config-moon](./packages/eslint-config) - ESLint config that extends `airbnb`, `unicorn`,
  `react`, and a handful of other plugins.
- [jest-preset-moon](./packages/jest-preset) - Jest preset that utilizes the circus runner, and
  provides code coverage.
- [prettier-config-moon](./packages/prettier-config) - Prettier config that aligns with
  accessibility and community standards.
- [tsconfig-moon](./packages/tsconfig) - TypeScript configs for normal, react, and reference based
  projects.

And last but not least, the [@moonrepo/dev](./packages/dev) package that provides helpers, constans,
and more. This should rarely be used directly!

## FAQ

### Can I contribute changes?

For the VS Code extension, yes!

For the configs, they're basically personal preference and won't change drastically. You're welcome
to use them as-is, but major changes are unlikely to land. Feel free to create an issue otherwise,
so that we can discuss any intended change.

### Why tabs over spaces?

The JavaScript ecosystem heavily prefers spaces over tabs. However, tabs are more accessible as they
allow developers with vision impairments to control their indentation and improve its readability.
Preferring accessibility compliance over a stylistic choice is always the better option.

### How are packages versioned?

To start, this repo utilizes [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
for versioning and publishing. We achieve this by requiring a
[specific prefix](https://github.com/beemojs/conventional-changelog-beemo#type) in pull request
titles. With that being said, the versioning strategy is as follows:

- Patch
  - Dependency upgrades.
  - Bug fixes.
- Minor
  - Enabling or disabling settings or lint rules.
  - Adding new dependencies (like babel plugins).
  - Adding new features.
- Major
  - Node.js minimum requirements / upgrades.
  - Major version upgrades for tools (e.g., eslint 7 -> 8).
